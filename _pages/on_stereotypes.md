        <p>A stereotype is defined in social psychology as a set of beliefs about others
        who are perceived as belonging to a different social category. The stereotype
        oversimplifies the group and generalizes a characteristic, applying it to all
        its members (Allport et al., 1954). Stereotypes are a cognitive component and,
        in agreement with prejudice, their emotional counterpart, they model behavior
        towards others. One way of manifesting stereotypes is through language, ranging
        in degrees from explicit to implicit expressions, thereby becoming a complex
        concept when operationalizing it for natural language processing purposes.
        Stereotypes are expressed in language through several communication acts, which
        can be explicit, that is, transparent and manifest, or implicit, that is, a
        process of inference is necessary for the stereotype to be perceived.</p>
        <p>Numerous works on stereotype detection and classification have been carried out
        in which specific social groups, e.g., women and immigrants, have been the focus
        of research, since they are usually the target of such messages. For instance,
        Automatic Misogyny Identification (Fersini et al., 2018) presents a
        classification subtask in which one of the categories of misogyny is Stereotype
        and Objectification understood as a fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a
        woman.
        EXIST (Rodríguez-Sánchez et al., 2021; Rodríguez-Sánchez et al., 2022; Plaza et al., 2023) tackled the
        topic of sexism in social networks, while more specifically, studies on the detection of gender
        stereotypes have also been addressed (Cryan et al., 2020; Chiril, 2021). Among the perspectives
        identifying stereotypes within narratives, there are studies on microportraits, in which a description of
        Muslim people is provided in a single text (Fokkens et al., 2018). Sap et al. (2019) addresses the issue
        of social bias frames driven by stereotypes. Evalita 2020’s HaSpeeDe 2 task includes a subtask on the
        identification of immigrants, Muslims and Roma (Sanguinetti et al., 2020). Narrowing down on the topic of
        immigration, Sánchez-Junquera et al. (2021) put forward a classification of such stereotypes as
        manifested in political debates. DETESTS-Dis is therefore an innovative proposal which goes a step
        further in stereotype identification by incorporating the identification of implicitly expressed
        stereotypes.</p>
